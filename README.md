# 🎟️ Tickets, Please

A short narrative-driven surviver game built in Unity 2D where you take on the role of child running from a ticket inspector.  
Your job? Don't let the inspector catch you.

This project was developed as part of a collaborative course assignment focused on combining two existing games.
